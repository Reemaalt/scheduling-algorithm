This project simulates process scheduling using a combination of Round Robin (RR) and Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithms. 
The simulator allows users to input processes with different priorities, arrival times, and CPU burst times, and it schedules
them accordingly, providing detailed reports on each process's performance metrics.
Upon running the simulator, follow the menu options to enter process information and generate reports.
